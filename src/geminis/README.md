# Geminis

This project creates a LLM-assisted Python fuzzing harness generator designed to leverage large language models like Gemini to automatically build fuzzing harnesses for target Python functions. It uses Googleâ€™s Atheris fuzzing engine to dynamically generate and test code, with the aim of uncovering bugs or vulnerabilities in software.
